					<hr>
					<p>Hello everyone, Salomi here! I am a huge lover of dogs, food, outdoor activities, and festivals.
						 I am a sociology major, and am currently finishing up my senior year here at UCSC
						  taking up pre-requisites for nursing school.  Some fun facts about me include: favorite
						   season being Fall and my got to drink to  at any coffee shop is a hot chocolate.
						    I also thoroughly enjoy delving into new music genre every so often.
					</p>
					<p>Hi, my name is Hilton! I enjoy playing video games or reading in my free time. I also
						 like to watch videos and livestreams or listening to music if I don't feel like doing any of those.
						  My favorite food is spaghetti, as shown above. Some of my other favorite things are the color red,
						   season being spring, and animal being cats.

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of Lab 2 is to create a webpage introducing our group using HTML and CSS.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that arose included finding the right combination of colors that would suit the web page and was decently aesthetically pleasing.
						Another problem we faced was importing fonts that are not included in the default suite of fonts for HTML, which we resolved by Googling
						how to do it. Changing font weight and border style were other problems we faced, but were solved through a quick lookup on Google.
						Essentially, we were able to solve these issues purely through experimenting.</p>
