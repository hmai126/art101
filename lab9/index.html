			<h1>Lab 9 - JavaScript for the Web</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>
						The challenge of this lab was to experiment with DOM manipulation
						to change HTML attributes on the webpage.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>
						I had some trouble changing the background color of the section
						boxes at first. So, I did some Googling and found that I would
						have to loop through the elements of that class to change the
						background color. I also struggled with trying to change the
						font for all text on the webpage. So, I had to do some more Googling
						and found a way of accessing all elements with a tag to change
						the fontFamily property.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						I think this was the first lab I had some serious struggle with.
						It took some effort to figure out how to modify the elements under
						a class and changing a property for all HTML tags. Overall, I would
						say that this lab is very helpful for JavaScript in the future.
					</p>
