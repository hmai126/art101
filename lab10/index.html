					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>
                        The challenge for this lab is to experiment with JavaScript
                        events and forms.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>
                        I did not have any struggles with this lab since the lecture
						that talked about JavaScript events and forms gave the knowledge
						I needed to create a form and take its input to be manipulated.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						Overall, I found this lab was pretty essential for teaching about
						JavaScript events and the forms we see on the Internet almost daily.
						I did not have to spent too much time on this lab since it was pretty
						straightforward if you followed the lecture.
