					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hi, I currently am a third year student at the University of California, Santa Cruz!
						I am a Computer Science: Game Design major who is in the process of changing to
						Art & Design: Games and Playable Media. I am an individual that likes to work with computers,
						so I feel like I want to be in a career in which they are involved. Some of my hobbies include
						playing video games in my free time, watching videos and livestreams, and reading manga on
						my phone.
